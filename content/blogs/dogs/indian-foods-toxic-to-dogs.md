# Indian Foods Toxic to Dogs: A Home-Kitchen Checklist

## Indian foods toxic to dogs: Quick answer (India context)
Indian foods toxic to dogs often show up in everyday meals, not just special occasions. Common risks in Indian homes include onion, garlic, masala gravies, chocolate, grapes/raisins, xylitol, caffeine, alcohol, and nutmeg. If you are unsure, it is safest to avoid sharing.

## Why Indian Dog Parents Ask This Question
Indian homes cook with strong spices, onions, and shared family meals. Dogs often sit nearby and get small bites, which makes it hard to know what is safe. This question is common in metros and tier-2 cities where home food is shared often.

## Common Indian Foods That Are Toxic for Dogs
### Onion, garlic, and mixed gravies
Onion and garlic are unsafe for dogs even in small amounts. They are common in masala bases, curries, and gravies.

### Chocolate, cocoa, and bakery items
Chocolate and cocoa are not safe for dogs. Indian bakery treats, cakes, and biscuits often contain them.

### Grapes and raisins in sweets and snacks
Grapes and raisins can be unsafe for dogs. They appear in festive sweets and dry-fruit mixes.

### Xylitol in sugar-free products
Sugar-free gums and sweets may contain xylitol. Even small amounts can be risky.

### Tea, coffee, and caffeine exposure
Chai, coffee, and caffeine-based drinks are common in Indian homes and are unsafe for dogs.

### Alcohol and fermented leftovers
Alcohol and fermented foods are unsafe. Avoid sharing leftovers that smell or taste fermented.

## Hidden Sources in Indian Kitchens
### Masala bases and tadka residues
Tadka and masala residue can carry onion, garlic, and heavy spices. Do not let dogs lick plates or pots.

### Pickles, chutneys, and packaged snacks
These are often high in salt, chili, and preservatives. They are not safe for dogs.

### Festive foods, mithai, and jaiphal (nutmeg)
Festive sweets can include chocolate, raisins, and nutmeg. Jaiphal is a common festive ingredient and should be avoided.

### Leftover curry-soaked rotis or rice
Rotis or rice soaked in curry carry spices and onion/garlic. These are risky even in small bites.

## Foods Often Confused as Safe
### Mild dairy like curd (depends on tolerance)
Curd can be tolerated by some dogs, but not all. See [curd safety guide](/blog/dogs/is-curd-safe-for-dogs-india).

### Plain rice vs spiced rice
Plain rice can be gentle, but spiced rice is not. See [rice safety guide](/blog/dogs/is-rice-safe-for-dogs-india).

### Plain roti vs stuffed or buttered roti
Plain roti is different from stuffed or buttered roti with masala. See [roti safety guide](/blog/dogs/can-dogs-eat-roti-india).

## If Your Dog Eats a Risky Food
### Stay calm and note what was eaten
Write down the food, amount, and time. This helps if you need to speak to a vet.

### Avoid home remedies
Do not try home fixes or force food or liquids. Keep your dog calm and observe.

### When to contact your vet immediately
If your dog is struggling to breathe, collapses, has seizures, or is unresponsive, seek emergency veterinary care immediately.

## What PawVeda Recommends
### Treat Indian home food as high-risk by default
Assume home food has hidden spices or onion/garlic unless you prepared it plain.

### Keep a visible “no-share” list in the kitchen
A simple list helps the whole family follow the same rules.

Check [PawVeda Food Safety guidance](/guides/food-safety) before offering any human food.
