# Project Completion Kit

This folder is the canonical reference hub for completing PawVeda. Keep it updated as decisions and scope evolve.

## Contents
- `Project Completion Kit/MVP_ANALYSIS.md` - repo-aligned analysis of what exists and what is missing.
- `Project Completion Kit/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - step-by-step plan to complete the MVP end-to-end.
- `Project Completion Kit/SUPABASE_SCHEMA.md` - snapshot of current Supabase tables and columns.

## Usage
- Update these docs before starting new work so the plan stays accurate.
- Add new working references here (prompts, specs, architecture notes).
- Keep filenames clear and stable so they can be cited in prompts.
- When backend work is involved, reference the sibling repo at `../pawveda-backend`.

## Conventions
- Prefer ASCII text.
- Reference repo files with inline code (example: `components/Dashboard.tsx`).
- Add dates or change notes if a section is significantly revised.
