# Monetization Analysis for Pawveda MVP

## Core truth
- People do not pay for "AI analysis" alone; they pay for time saved, money saved, or anxiety reduced at a moment of urgency.

## Start Here (each session)
- [ ] Validate that triage + vet brief reduces anxiety in under 2 minutes.
- [ ] Keep pricing simple: pay-per-use before subscriptions.
- [ ] Do not expand monetization until core loop is working and trusted.

## What pet owners pay for
- Urgency and anxiety relief: "Is this an emergency?"
- Convenience: booking, reminders, meds, records.
- Cost reduction: avoid unnecessary ER visits, prevent costly issues.
- Compliance: easy treatment plans, meds, diet adherence.

## What they will not pay for
- Generic AI dashboards without a decision or action.
- Breed insights that are widely available for free.
- PDFs that do not save real time for owners or vets.

## High-value pain points with willingness to pay
1) Triage: "Emergency vs wait"
2) Structured history: meds, symptoms, timeline, allergies
3) Admin simplification: multi-pet records and reminders
4) Chronic care workflows: diabetes, allergies, arthritis

## Best wedge
- Triage plus a vet-ready report that reduces anxiety and saves time.

## Product angle
"Get a clear next step in 2 minutes plus a vet-ready health brief."

Flow:
- Symptom triage (text + optional photo/video)
- Outcome: Emergency / Visit soon / Monitor + home care
- Vet Brief: timeline, key symptoms, meds, allergies, last visits, photos
- Export PDF/share link
- Optional: clinic or tele-vet connection

## Monetization models
1) Per-use: $6–$15 for triage + report
2) Subscription: $5–$12/month for records + reminders + chronic care
3) Clinic partnerships: $100–$500/month for better intake and histories
4) Tele-vet affiliate/referral fees

## Validation plan
- 20 interviews with owners who had a pet scare in the last 60 days.
- Ask: "What did you do? What did it cost? What would you pay for certainty?"
- Prototype a 2-minute triage flow (Typeform + PDF output).
- Charge immediately (even $5) to test willingness to pay.
- Measure conversion, repeat usage, and WTP.

## Immediate experiments (next 2 weeks)
- Launch a payment-gated vet brief (manual link is fine).
- Track conversion: triage start → outcome view → pay → brief export.
- Offer a 7-day records + reminders trial after the brief.

## Brutal truth
- AI insight is not the product; decision clarity and record quality are.
- If it cannot calm a worried owner quickly, they will not pay.
