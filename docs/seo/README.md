# PawVeda SEO System (Docs)

This folder is the single source of truth for:
- What we target (pillars + clusters)
- How we write (templates)
- How we link (internal linking rules)
- How we publish (SOP)

Golden rule:
No page/blog ships unless it follows:
- page_template.md
- internal_linking_rules.md
- trust_and_disclaimer_blocks.md
