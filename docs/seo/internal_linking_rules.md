# Internal Linking Rules

## Minimum linking per blog
- 1 → its pillar page
- 2 → related blogs (same pet type)
- 1 optional → product page (only if relevant, soft)

## Anchor Text Rules
- Must read naturally
- Prefer descriptive anchors (not exact match spam)

## Pillar linking
Each pillar:
- Links to all cluster blogs
- Has a "Start here" section
- Includes "Top questions" FAQ

## Avoid
- Linking dogs blog to cats blog unless query intent overlaps
- Repeating the same anchor text sitewide
